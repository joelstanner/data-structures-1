# data-structures
Contains a number of classic data structures, implemented in python.
This file contains:
Singly linked list
    Data structure utilizing nodes
    References for list:

Stack
    Data structure utilizing nodes with a "First In, Last Out" 
    organization.
    contains two constructors, one for the data node, and one
    for the stack itself. 
    The stack contains a reference to the first data node, and that
    is all. 
    A node contains a data value, along with a reference to the next
    node.
Queue 
    Data structure that push values into the back of list, then spits
    them out of the front, in the order they were pushed.
    Enqueue adds nodes to the back of the list
    dequeue pops nodes off the top of the list
    size checks the length of the queue
