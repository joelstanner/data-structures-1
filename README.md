Stack
    Data structure utilizing nodes with a "First In, Last Out" 
    organization.
    contains two constructors, one for the data node, and one
    for the stack itself. 
    The stack contains a reference to the first data node, and that
    is all. 
    A node contains a data value, along with a reference to the next
    node.
